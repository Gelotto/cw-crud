# CosmWasm CRUD Smart Contract

This smart contract came into existence for the express purpose of allowing us
to manage collections of other contracts, efficiently indexing, sorting and
paginating them. This goes a long way in eliminating the need to store contract
addresses in a traditional database, keeping it all on-chain.
